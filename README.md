# ProbabilityProblem&BayesianModeling

The attached dataset represents football games across the ages. Just like F1 drivers with lots of points have a higher chance of winning, teams that have been higher scorers in the past have a greater likelihood of scoring goals in the future.
Treat the number of goals scored by the home and away team as two independent Poisson distributions. Consider the number of goals scored by each team to be independent events (i.e. P(A n B) = P(A) P(B))
Model the Skellam distribution of european teams playing non-european teams. Do it with an analytic approach (MOM). Exploring bayesian modeling methodology using pymc3.
Use your model to calculate the probability of a draw between a european team and a non-european team. The probability of a draw is simply the sum of the events where the two teams score the same amount of goals.
